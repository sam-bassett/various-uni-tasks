=================

Collected important tasks from the first two years of university. "15-puzzle" has an algorithm based on A* which solves the 15-puzzle problem (written in C).
"Enigma" has an implementation of the Enigma encoding machine from World War 2 (written in Java).
"CatanFinal" is the first large project I was involved in - it's an implementation of the board game "Settlers of Catan" in C. 
"Mandelbrot" has a simple mandelbrot fractal generator in it. It was fun to code, note the webserver wasn't my group. Also written in C.
"Roma" is a Java project which allows the user to play the board game Roma through the command line.
